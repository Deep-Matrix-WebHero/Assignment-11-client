          <h1 className="blog-title">1. Jungles In Paris</h1>
          <p class="blog-overview">
            What I love about it: Jungles in Paris takes travel storytelling
            into a deeper level away from the usual topics travel blogs like to
            write and more in the territory of a deeper understanding of
            countries' cultures and traditions. It's a breath of fresh air to
            read stories about "The Amazon Most Endangered Hunters" than another
            guide to a city or a country.

          <p class="blog-overview">
            What I love about it: Aileen is one of my favorite travel bloggers.
            She writes her travel articles from a perspective of a third-world
            country passport holder (like me) and she shares her story with
            amazingly thorough detail, pastel-colored photography and easily
            digestible list.

          <h1 className="blog-title">3. Along Dusty Roads</h1>
          <p class="blog-overview">
            Their article about The Forgotten Animals of Bolivia has not just
            amazing photography but also a clean design that put the focus on
            the content first and foremost and is easily digestible. I remember
            reading their blogs extensively when I was traveling in Colombia and
            Ecuador.

          <h1 className="blog-title">4. Our Wild Abandon</h1>
          <p class="blog-overview">
            What I love about it: Our Wild Abandon is a creative and quirky
            travel blog by the duo Kyla and Jill with stories that will make you
            want to run away with them and do long road trips around the world
            forever. It's like On the Road book by Jack Kerouac envisioned in
            the 21st century and split into smaller stories for internet
            consumption. Their layout design, for example on their Yosemite
            story, is almost invisible, making ways for the stories and
            photography to shine and take over.

          <h1 className="blog-title">5. Anywhere We Roam</h1>
          <p class="blog-overview">
            A great example of this can be seen on articles like Impressions of
            Havana - A story from the streets where the duo takes you through
            the street of Havana exploring its culture and vibe through
            atmospheric photography and immersive writing that will make you
            feel like you are there yourself.

          <h1 className="blog-title">6. Maptia</h1>
          <p class="blog-overview">
            The Gathering of Giants travel story by Tony Wu is an excellent
            example of Maptia's superior content that you can't get from any
            where else. Seeing the extremely detailed photos and reading the
            well-written story on this article is as close as you can get to
            being near these beautiful stunning whales.
